## NEM Knowledge Base

Here you'll find detailed information and practical guides on how NEM works and how to use it. NEM has many more features and built-in services than most other blockchain platforms, with more on the way, so there's probably still some features we haven't fully covered on this site. We are constantly working to add material so check back now and then to see new developments.

If you have a question that isn't answered here, try asking in the [NEM forums](https://forum.nem.io/) or on any of our other supported community channels such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nemofficial/) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ourNEM/) and [Telegram](https://t.me/nemred).
